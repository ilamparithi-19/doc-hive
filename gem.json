The manner in which he addressed her complex health issues, explained her condition with clarity, and guided us through every step of the treatment has been truly remarkable. His calm demeanor, clear communication, and thoughtful approach gave us immense confidence and reassured my wife during this challenging period.Despite initial advice from a reputed international hospital in Porur for an open surgery, Dr. Senthilnathan sir successfully performed the procedure laparoscopically, showcasing his exceptional proficiency in minimally invasive surgery. My wife recovered remarkably well, walking back home within a week without any complications‚Äîan outcome that far exceeded our expectations.I am particularly grateful for the time and personal attention Dr. Senthilnathan sir continues to invest in her care, despite his demanding schedule. His tireless commitment to ensuring her well-being and recovery has been a great source of relief and comfort for our family. His reassurance and compassionate care have had a profound impact on her emotional and physical health, giving us the strength and hope to face each day.The environment at GEM Hospital further amplified this positive experience. The facility was impeccably clean, and the welcoming, patient-friendly atmosphere was a stark contrast to the typical hospital environment. This greatly contributed to my wife‚Äôs comfort and overall well-being during her stay.I wholeheartedly recommend GEM Hospital, Chennai, and Dr. Senthilnathan P. Surgeon gastroenterologist for anyone seeking advanced and compassionate care for gastroenterology-related treatments. Their dedication to patient care and medical excellence is truly commendable.Thank you once again, Dr. Senthilnathan, sir and the entire team at GEM Hospital, for setting a benchmark in medical care and ensuring such a seamless experience for my family. We are fortunate to have a doctor like you and remain grateful for the exceptional comfort and quality of care you continue to provide . As a member of the uniformed service, I am trained to recognize excellence and precision. I extend my heartfelt gratitude and a big salute to you for the successful laparoscopic surgery. God bless you sir ."

He took the time to thoroughly explain the biology behind my condition, which helped me stay calm during a very uncertain time. I was admitted on the same day, and the nurses who cared for me were nothing short of wonderful. Despite my occasional tantrums, they remained patient and calm, which I truly appreciate.Before deciding on surgery, Dr. Ajay recommended an ultrasound, and thankfully, the intussusception resolved on its own. I was so relieved that surgery wasn‚Äôt necessary, and I‚Äôm grateful that Dr. Ajay took the time to carefully consider whether surgery was truly needed, given that my diagnosis wasn‚Äôt fully consistent with the symptoms I was experiencing.Throughout my stay, several relationship managers checked in to ensure my comfort and satisfaction with the service.

And at our utmost dire situation we were met with the most atrocious treatment ever from the hospitals side. We were left extremely disappointed, beginning with the slow response of bringing a stretcher to escorting us poorly back into the vehicle. They failed to properly assess the situation and provide the necessary treatment. The only available doctor, Dr.Adarsh, who we required immediate help from responded to our situation with such nonchalant attitude and absurd behaviour. The doctor and other nurses were all incredibly casual and unresponsive to us. At last when he had no other option he finally decided to mention that this hospital doesn‚Äôt have the necessary treatment and suggested us to go elsewhere. this could‚Äôve been mentioned to us much earlier and we could‚Äôve avoided the hassle and waste of time. While trying to get back to the vehicle with the patient who was still in need of help, the doctor abandoned the situation and all the other nurses did not even bother to help.

Dr Palanivelu sir has got great hands for laparoscopic surgery. Supporting Doctors were also excellent. Specifically to mention Dr. Sreeram, Sr. Consultant. A special mention about three, Urologist Dr. Yuvaraj, his secretary Ms. Malliga, excellent human beings. And last but not the least the very important person Ms. Prathiba, Dr Palanivelu's secretary though I had difficulties in reaching her out in the initial stages things went very well and she had done an excellent coordination later and from the time of admission and till discharge. Nursing and support staffs were excellent and always kind and smiling. Hospital is very neatly maintained. Patient food served was excellent quality. In medical treatment, we don't use such statement. But I would go ahead and say that. \"\"Getting a treatment from GEM hospital is value for money\"\". The director of the hospital visited personally and wished me a continued well being. So kind of her. Thank you Ma'am. Hence, I would strongly recommend this hospital as the best one. While these are many positives, there are few areas where they can improve things. (a) Digitizing patient records (b) Having an internal CT Angiogram facility / equipment - I am not sure if they did not have specific CT Angiogram what the Cardiologist recommended to do for me. Later the CT Angio requirement was proposed as optional. (c) Cleanliness of the common bathrooms and toilets (d) Something has to be done at the Canteen located at the 5th Floor about FLIES. Though the fly trap is there, its not working with the flies. Canteen Bill Counter can smile a little to make our minds also smile. He (a young boy) always talks with a grim face."

He took the time to speak with my 71-year-old mother, understanding her anxiety, and reassured her about the minimally invasive nature of the procedure. His calm demeanor and clear communication instilled confidence and comfort in both my mother and our family.Dr. Senthilnathan's proficiency in Laparoscopic surgery was evident as he successfully performed what was initially considered to require an open surgery. The procedure was completed with minimal invasion, and my mother was able to walk back home within a week. This quick recovery period exceeded our expectations and underscored Dr. Senthilnathan's exceptional skills.The hospital environment at Gem Hospital, Chennai, further enhanced our positive experience. The facility was impeccably clean and maintained a welcoming atmosphere that did not feel like a typical hospital.

All the paperwork and appointments were taken care of by Pradeepa, who made it hassle-free for us. On the day of surgery, the doctor met us in person and explained the gravity of the situation. He informed us of the various approaches he has planned for this particular case and explained everything in detail. We were more than confident only because our family member is in safe hands. We completely trusted Dr. Palanivelu sir‚Äîhis skills and expertise. Post-surgery, we again got to meet the doctor, who confirmed everything went well.Post surgery during the recovery phase Dr. Sreeram sir and Dr. Srinivasan sir visited the patient twice every day to make sure everything was fine and the patient was recovering.The nurses who took care of room number 310 will always be close to our hearts. Kabila sister, Soundarya sister, Divya sister, and a few more were always on their toes. Their constant reassurance and their politeness made the post-surgery phase even easier.Above all this, we had food being delivered from the canteen for both the attendee and patient. Although the food was prepared so hygienically, just like home-made food, the person who delivered it made it even more pleasant. We had Muthurasu, who always walked with a smiling face and delivered the yummiest food one can never expect in hospitals.I understand this might look like a staycation review/feedback, but I personally wanted to mention all their names not only to thank them but also to bring them to the limelight so that even their management can be proud of how excellent their staffs have been with their dear patients. Everyone from house keeping team, ward boys and dieticians who visited were were kind and very professional.We also had director ma'am, who took time and visited us on the day of discharge. We then got to know that she visits patients on their day of discharge to get their feedback.On the whole, we would highly recommend Dr. Palanivelu and his team of doctors, nurses, and everyone who works there, as they were all TRUELY GEM!"

They have a top-notch gynaecology department that is fully equipped to handle high-risk pregnancies like mine. My doctor, Delphin Supriya, was excellent throughout my pregnancy journey and gave me the exact type of birth experience i sought. At the end, she encouraged me even when I was too consumed by pain and motivated me to have a fairly quick and normal delivery. I'm very grateful to her and applaud her kindness, professionalism and exceptional care of me and our baby. OBGYN Dr Nandhini who also played a big role in my delivery had the right things to say to help encourage me to speed up my delivery. A big thanks to her as well. Finally, Dr Harishmitha was around night and day to ensure my vitals were stable and addressed all my concerns. I appreciate her diligence throughout my stay.A special mention of Sister Kannaga from the gynaecology department - from Day 1 of my pregnancy, she has taken care of me everytime I stepped into the hospital. Such a kind and efficient nurse who was always willing to help. Similarly, PRO Rashika helped me and my husband sort through the insurance and hospital stay and ensured we were assigned a room that fully satisfied us. She's a great troubleshooter!The Labour Nurses and Housekeeping took great care of me and my baby. Special mention of Sister Bhuvaneshwari who taught me and husband several important skills to care for our baby as we are first-time parents.Everyone at the Sample Collection department was always helpful.  Similarly the folks at Reception and Billing were kind and warm to us every time we stepped into the hospital and were very invested in our journey. They were thrilled to meet our baby and spend time with him.What we got at GEM was a homey experience with a whole bunch of warm and caring staff-- they always checked on my health and comfort even when they were busy. Truly grateful to everyone and would highly recommend anyone looking for a skilled team to delivery their baby to think no further and head to GEM Hospital, Perungudi!"

It was a hasslefree experience with the admission, surgery and discharge. Good care shown by doctors, nurses and dietician, including explaining details and giving good comfort to feel confident.Couple of improvements: Vidal TPA is not being done cashless. I had to pay and claim. Learnt that the hospital had a finance partner for this but we did not use them.Still appreciate the insurance team for prompt help with the guidance and filling up the forms for my claim.Housekeeping/bathroom cleanliness is next to perfect. I had to call the housekeeping and request for cleaning so as to get a good standard of cleanliness in the room.Cafeteria provides good and clean food for patients and attenders. However use of plastic containers for daily food to patients must be avoided in these go green/environment friendly requirement days. Please consider using tiffin carriers or hot packs."

During 2 months of period he was admitted only 2 times (6 Days + 3 Days = 9 Days) and visited Emergency Care Twice.I am really lucky to treat my father-in-law in Gem Hospital as they never did anything (Admission, Treatment, Medicines) for money and treated with the highest form of moral ethics. I have been told by the Doctors that they do not want the patient to suffer in the ICU and they ensure the patient lives without much discomfort.  My father-in-law has suffered only for one night, as he became so weak and could not respond to us and passed away peacefully.The moral support provided by each and every Doctor, Nurse, Front Office Staff and all other employees was excellent.  It would have been a nightmare for us without their excellent medical care and moral support. We strongly felt that we were handled by our own relatives.Thank You very much to the entire Gem Hospital - Perungudi Team from all our family members."

I was happy to see that the emergency duty doctor, Ashvini, and the entire night staff were polite and took good care of me. I was shivering badly and had a fever, and they gave me three blankets parellely treatment was going onn, my shivering did not stop. I appreciate that they turned off the air conditioner in the emergency room at midnight during the summer because I was the only patient there and they couldn't see me suffer. About eight to nine staff members stayed in the emergency room for two hours until I was discharged, and they turned off the AC for me. This shows very good customer Approach. Other hospitals would not do this, giving technical reasons for not turning off centralized AC.They also treated me well. Few hospitals will insists for admission for every night treatment patients. These guys sent me off once I was Allright..Their hospital bills and fees are very reasonable for middle-class and upper-middle-class people. Kudos to the entire night shift emergency team. Thank you very much! üëÉüëÉüëÉ"

From the outset, Dr. Srinivasan, a gastroenterologist, was kind, polite, transparent and forthcoming about the surgery. The staff were highly experienced and provided excellent care. They were well-trained and excellent in service. They took great care during surgery and follow-up after surgery.I would like to extend my gratitude to the doctors at GEM Hospital, particularly Dr. Senthil Nathan, Dr. Srivatsan Gurumurthy, Dr. Srinivasan Mani, and PRO Monisha. I am pleased to report that my brother's condition has improved significantly. The hospital is well-maintained and meets all hygiene standards. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were consistently satisfied with the care provided. I am certain that our decision to select this hospital was the right one.I would like to extend my congratulations to the staff and management of GEM Hospital for their dedication and commitment to providing excellent care."

As she has underwent the pain of stone surgery before, she was scared to go through that ordeal again. But after meeting  Dr. Senthil Nathan, Dr. Jayanth and Dr. Yuvaraj, she got the comfort after the explanations and promises by all the three and and agreed for the surgical procedure and as promised they combined both the surgeries and completed the same in an excellent way which my wife was so happy after the procedure. While recuperating she is comparing the pain she underwent earlier and how she is feeling now. Thanks for the team of Doctors - including the Anaesthetist who supported the surgery and other doctors who were involved.It was a nice experience for us in the hospital with excellent service by the Nurses and the support staff who were so kind and supportive and ready to extend any help at any time. The food provided was good and the maintenance and cleanliness was excellent .I want to mention very specifically that none of the support staff or security were expecting any kind of tips which was surprising to us as we had faced the menace in other hospitals and were so kind too.Finally i want to mention about the support received from the Finance team (Saranya) who was very helpful with handling the complicated twin surgery procedure claim with my insurance.I would certainly recommend GEM hospital to my friends and family for getting a better treatment."

I had no hope that my depression would go, but after 3 meetings with her everything changed. I got my mental peace back.  The way she talks opens eyes. She creates a sister like bond like an angel. I recommend everyone who has psychic problems to see her once. Fees is small, but Mrs Mridula is too great in her profession. I still meet her once in two months out of gratefulness and immense affection. All the best to the lucky ones who gets to meet her.        Rajesh lingam, Film Director"

His smiling. face was an inspiration and encourages me to proceed with the surgery. Ofcourse, the surgery was done neatly and I am recovering fast. Throughout my stay in the hospital, the services of the staff while taking the necessary blood tests and other investigative tests were simply best. The visits by doctors post surgery explaining all my queries, the utmost care taken by all the nursing staff and other supporting staff was really great.The administrative staff including the insurance department were very helpful. The pleasant surprise was the visit of the Director, Mrs.Senthilnathan enquiring about the facilities and wishing for speedy recovery. A special mention to be made about Miss.Prathiba who has guided me right from the beginning till I was discharged for her valuable services.All the doctor's and other staff were very kind and were responsible and responsive.The ambience of the hospital and the cleanliness of the rooms and surroundings were excellent.In short, the Gem hospital is really a gem of a hospital."
